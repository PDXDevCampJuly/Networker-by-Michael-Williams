<p>Networker is a secure, responsive web application for constructing private groups. The user group for this project will be a “mock family network”. The application will provide the opportunities to login into a secure environment, build a phone book, track user locations of residency,  observe analytics based on the user group profiles, communicate through project-based message system. The project-based message system will allow for the users to collaborate on specific goals and communicate through posts and uploads. 
</p>

<p>The idea is to reach within your network for assistance before seeking assistance outside of your network. This strengthens the network and reduces the existence of weak links.</p>
